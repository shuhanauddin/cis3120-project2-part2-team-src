Program for part 2 of project 2
For this this question we compared the average heights of college swimmers and volleyball players by scraping athlete roster data from college websites. Ramsil Perez extractd and analyzed height data from men’s and women’s swimming and volleyball teams across multiple schools and saved the data in a csv files. Shuhana Uddin created the python script and deliverables for the bar graph showing height distribution by category. Crisleidy Roman was responsible for creating and organizing the SQL database. She used SQLite to build a table that stores athlete height and school data from four CSV files: men’s swimming, women’s swimming, men’s volleyball, and women’s volleyball. She also imported and validated the data using SQL commands in the terminal, ensuring a clean and complete dataset with 497 total records. Once the database (athletes_simple.db) was completed, she committed it to our team’s GitHub repository and also created a separate branch (sql-database) to preserve my individual contribution.

This type of problem is useful in collecting clean, analyzing, vizualizing and comparing real world data. It also helps develop analytical skills by using python to calculate averages and identifying patterns like who’s the tallest/shortest between genders in sports. This problem also sharpens our ability to interpret quantitative information by transforming raw data into visuals.
